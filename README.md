# snippitbox
A very small app to share very small things. Well, so far, a very small app that can get compiled.

This is a single file app written in .NET 6 beta something or other and using ASP.NET Core 6 beta somethingorother. Since you probably don't want beta bits on your local machine, you can execute `.\run-docker` to get a tagged image called `snippitbox`. You can then execute `.\run-docker` to start a container with that tagged image on port 8000 in interactive mode (`ctrl+c` to kill it).
